#Homework #3 for Jeff Nieman

library(stringr)

#Question 8.3a
#First I need to duplicate the data for the question.  This is found in "Automated Data Collection in R", p. 206.
raw.data <- c("555-1239Moe Szlyslak(636) 555-0113Burns, C. Montgomery555-6542Rev. Timothy Lovejoy555 8904Ned Flanders636-555-3226Simpson, Homer5553642Dr. Julius Hibbert")
name <- unlist(str_extract_all(raw.data, "[[:alpha:]., ]{2,}"))
name
# Now that we have just the names we need to move them so we simply have first name last name.  I am considering the first name of C. MOntgomery Burns as "C." since this is not a title. 
name1 <- str_replace(name, pattern="Burns, C. Montgomery", replacement="C. Burns")
name1
name2 <- str_replace(name1,pattern="Simpson, Homer", replacement="Homer Simpson")
name2
name3<- gsub("Rev. |Dr. ", "", name2)
name3

#Question 8.3b
#The str_detect fuction will give me a true/false output for the titles.
str_detect(name, "Rev.|Dr.")

#Question 8.3c
#The approach I took here was to eliminate titles and to count the spaces between the names.  Then using string count I call true those who have 2 spaces as a middle name, while those who have one space will be false with no middle name shown.
name4<- gsub("Rev. |Dr. ","", name)
name4
spacecount <- str_count(name4, pattern=" ")
spacecount
str_detect(spacecount, pattern="2")

#Question 8.6a
#For fun and practice I did question 6 which allowed me to learn about str_c as a way of combining.
email <- ("chunkylover53[at]aol[dot]com")
email
email1 <- str_extract(email, "[a-z0-9]+")
email1
email2 <- "@"
email3 <- str_sub(email,start=18,end=20)
email3
email4="."
email5 <- str_sub(email,start=26,end=28)
email5
emailfinal<- str_c(email1,email2,email3,email4,email5)
emailfinal

#Question 8.6b
#Use str_extract_all to see numerical part of email address.  Using simply [:digit:] will separate the 5 and 3.  You need to add {2} to allow for 2 digit   You could also use [:digit:][:digit:].
b <-  str_extract_all(emailfinal, "[:digit:]{2}")
b
c <- str_extract_all(emailfinal, "[:digit:][:digit:]")
c

#Question 8.6c
#Using "\\D" will cause two problems.  First the capital letter will cause it to show no digits, it needs to be "\\d".  Second, there needs to be a {2} or some other means to bring in the two digit number.
d <- str_extract_all(emailfinal, "\\d{2}")
d

#Question 8.7 
#Using "<.+>" fails because it calls all characters between the < and > and there is a > at the end.  This will pull the entire string.  A better solution using predefined symbols is shown below.
s <- "<title>+++BREAKING NEWS+++<title>"
s1 <- str_extract(s, "<\\w+>")
s1

#Question 8.8  
#There were two problems with the approach of the question.  First, the symbol "^" was first so it negated the numbers, reading the symbol as "not [0-9].  Second, the symbol "-" was left out.  Corrected approach is shown below.
test <- "(5-3)^2=5^2-2*5*3+3^2 conforms to the binomial theorem."
test1 <- str_extract_all(test, "[0-9-=+*()^]+")
test1


#Question 8.9
#The key here is to extract the capital letters and the punction.  Solution provided below to see the secret message.  Although< i like to think that I am not a supernerd!
